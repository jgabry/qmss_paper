@article{gelman_prior_2006,
	Abstract = {Various noninformative prior distributions have been suggested for scale parameters in hierarchical models. We construct a new folded-noncentral-tt family of conditionally conjugate priors for hierarchical standard deviation parameters, and then consider noninformative and weakly informative priors in this family. We use an example to illustrate serious problems with the inverse-gamma family of "noninformative" prior distributions. We suggest instead to use a uniform prior on the hierarchical standard deviation, using the half-tt family when the number of groups is small and in other settings where a weakly informative prior is desired. We also illustrate the use of the half-tt family for hierarchical modeling of multiple variance parameters such as arise in the analysis of variance.},

@article{cox_gerrymandering_2007,
	Abstract = {We argue that the standard toolbox used in electoral studies to assess the bias and responsiveness of electoral systems can also be used to assess the bias and responsiveness of legislative systems. We consider which items in the toolbox are the most appropriate for use in the legislative setting, then apply them to estimate levels of bias in the U.S. House from 1879 to 2000. Our results indicate a systematic bias in favor of the majority party over this period, with the strongest bias arising during the period of ``czar rule'' (51st--60th Congresses, 1889--1910) and during the post-packing era (87th--106th Congresses, 1961--2000). This finding is consistent with the majority party possessing a significant advantage, either in ``buying'' vote options, in setting the agenda, or both.},
