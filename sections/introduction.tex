\label{introduction}

In some sense, it is a tautology to assert that quantitative historical analyses in the social sciences should begin from the premise that parameters of interest may exhibit considerable variation over time. The entire enterprise makes little sense if it is assumed a priori that parameters will be constant -- parameter homogeneity should be discovered, not imposed. That is, there is a difference between hypothesizing that temporal variation in parameters is minimal and building a model that guarantees it. 

Nevertheless, there are many examples in the literature of models that presuppose parameters are invariant to time as well as models that do not explicitly make this assumption but lack the flexibility to discover variation if present.  Even methods that do attempt to allow for important variation often sacrifice some degree of statistical coherence, requiring other dubious assumptions or questionable treatment of the data.\footnote{Part~\ref{cox_katz} of this thesis discusses one such example.}

\citeA{wawro_designing_2014} argue that the standard quantitative approaches for historical analysis in the social sciences are insufficient for addressing certain key features common to the most successful historical analyses. Citing the concerns of qualitatively-inclined political historians, Katznelson and Wawro contend that traditional methods lack attention to the nuanced ideas of temporality, periodicity, context and specificity.\footnote{Note that here periodicity is not used in the mathematical sense but rather refers how relationships between variables are influenced differently by break points in history at particular locations and times.}  Rejecting ``... the idea that one must choose between historical depth and quantitative rigor," they propose a Bayesian approach to the historical study of political institutions -- and historical social scientific inquiry in general --  that centers on relaxing structural assumptions and embracing  parameter heterogeneity when appropriate (p. 527). Specifically, Wawro and Katznelson demonstrate that semi-parametric mixed models with historically relevant smoothing priors can accommodate greater parameter variation and let the data play a larger role in guiding inferences without sacrificing the stability of estimates as the parameters-to-data ratio becomes large.  

Wawro and Katznelson present these ideas in the context of two reanalyses of studies from the subfield of American Political Development. In this thesis another empirical analysis is conducted demonstrating the merits of Katznelson and Wawro's recommendations. Similar in content and style to the applied statistics literature, considerable space is given to a formal description of the proposed statistical models, as well as a discussion of computational implementations and challenges thereof.
