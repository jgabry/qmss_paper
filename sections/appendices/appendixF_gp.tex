\subsection{Gaussian process priors}

Preliminary results from analysis with Gaussian process smoothness priors. The estimates
for bias toward the majority party are slightly different (and less stable) than the estimates 
from the model with $RW_1$ priors, but both suggest similar trends in bias over time.  
We are currently studying the sensitivity of the results to the chosen kernel (covariance function).  
The plot below is generated using a generalized squared exponential kernel.
